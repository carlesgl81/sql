What are DB?
Systems that allow users to store and organize data.

PostGre SQL is Open Source, Free and multiplatform.

SQL (Structured Query Language) 
SQL is the programming language used to communicate with our Database.

SQL 

SELECT Customer_id, first_name, last_name
FROM Sales
ORDER BY first_name;

PostgreSQL - SQL Engine
PGAdmin - Graphical User Interface for connecting with PostGreSQL.

SQL Sintax

SELECT
SELECT column_name FROM table_name
SELECT C1, C2 FROM table_1
SELECT * FROM Table_1

SELECT DISTINCT
Gets the different/unique values in a column.
SELECT DISTINCT column FROM Table;

COUNT Function
Returns the number of input rows that match a specific condition of a query.
SELECT COUNT(columnname) FROM TABLE;
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT name) FROM Table;

SELECT and WHERE
The WHERE Statement allows us to specify conditions on columns for the rows to be returned.

SELECT Column1, Column2
FROM Table
WHERE conditions;

Comparison Operators
= Equal
> Greater Than
< Less Than
>= Greater than or equal to
<= Less than or equal to
<> or != Not Equal to

Logical Operators
AND, OR, NOT

SELECT name FROM Table 
WHERE name = 'David' AND choice = 'Red'

In PostgreSQL ';' at the end is optional.

SELECT title FROM film
WHERE Rental_rate > 4 AND replacement_cost >= 19.99 AND rating = 'R';

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM film
WHERE Rental_rate > 4 OR replacement_cost >= 19.99 AND rating = 'R';

Challenge: Find the email of the customer Nancy Thomas:
SELECT email FROM Customer
WHERE First_name = 'Nancy' AND Last_name = 'Thomas';

Challenge 2: Get the description for the movie Outlaw Hanky
SELECT description FROM film
WHERE title = 'Outlaw Hanky'

Challenge 3: Get the phone number for the customer who leaves in the 259 Ipoh Drive address.
SELECT Phone FROM Address
WHERE address = '259 Ipoh Drive';

ORDER BY
You can use ORDER BY to sort rows based on a column value, in either ascending or descending order.
SELECT Column1, Column2
FROM table
ORDER BY column1 ASC/DESC;

Ascending is default if you donÂ´t specify anything.

SELECT store_id, first_name, last_name FROM customer
ORDER BY store_id DESC, first_name ASC

LIMIT
Limits the shown results.
It is the last command to get executed.

Shows all from payment date in descensing order but only the first 5 results.
SELECT * FROM payment
ORDER BY payment_date DESC
LIMIT 5

Challenge1: Find the 10 first customers who paid something in the company.
SELECT customer_id FROM payment
ORDER BY payment_date ASC
LIMIT 10

Challenge2: Titles of the 5 shortest (time) movies.
SELECT title FROM film
ORDER BY length ASC
LIMIT 5

Challenge3: How many movies are in the DB with 50 or less minutes.
SELECT COUNT(title) FROM film
WHERE length <= 50

BETWEEN
Matches a value against a range of values:
	Value >= low AND value <= high
	Value BETWEEN low AND high.
	
NOT BETWEEN
	Value < low OR value > high
	Value NOT BETWEEN low AND high

IN
Value IN(option1, option2,...,option_n)
So in this query, everything in red and/or blue will return to us.
	SELECT color FROM table
	WHERE color IN('red','blue')
Here, will find the payments with 0.99, 1.98 and 1.99.
	SELECT COUNT (*) FROM payment
	WHERE amount IN (0.99,1.98,1.99)

NOT IN
If we use NOT IN in the last query, we will get all the payments with other amounts.

LIKE / ILIKE
Using Pattern Matching
	To find out what emails are ending in gmail.com or all names that begin with A.
	2 Wildcard characters for this:
		% : Matches any sequence of characters. (Names begin with A. WHERE name LIKE 'A%'. Names that end with an a. WHERE name LIKE '%a')
		_ : Matches any single character. (Get all the Rocky films(1,2,3,4). WHERE title LIKE 'Rocky _'
	LIKE is case-sensitive. ILIKE is not case-sensitive.
	We can combine pattern matching operators to create more complex patterns (WHERE name LIKE '_her%'. to find out cHERyl, tHEResa, sHERrri)
 
BIG Challenge 1:
How many payment transactions were greater than $5 ?
SELECT COUNT(amount) FROM payment
WHERE amount > 5
How many actors have first name that starts with letter P?
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM actor
WHERE first_name LIKE 'P%'
How many unique districts are our customer from?
SELECT Count(DISTINCT district)
FROM address
List of the names from last question.
SELECT DISTINCT (district)
FROM address
How many films have a rating of R and a replacement cost between $5 and $15?
SELECT COUNT (film_id) 
FROM film
WHERE rating = 'R' AND replacement_cost BETWEEN 5 AND 15
How many films have the world Truman somewhere in the title?
SELECT COUNT (Title) FROM film
WHERE Title LIKE '%Truman%'
